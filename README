Information about project files for using forecasts found on Unidata
servers to make power output predictions.

To accomplish this the siphon library is used to remotely access
the forecast data and power output predictions are made using the 
pvlib library.

File Descriptions:

pvlib_siphon.py - initial implementaiton of the siphon library.
pvlibfm.py - class file for forecasts from Unidata.
fm_testing.py - replicates tests in pvlib_siphon.py using class objects.
    In order for this to work, the pvlibfm.py file must be in the same
    directory that this file is called from.
