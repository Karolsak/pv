In order to run these examples, you need to do the following:

1. If you do not have an ipython profile, create a default one one using:

ipython profile create

2. Edit ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_kernel_config.py and add the line:

c.IPKernelApp.matplotlib = 'inline'

Now when you start an ipython notebook, you will not need to include the 
ipython magic command "%matplotlib inline" to get inline figures.

Why not include the magic command in these notebooks directly? These notebooks
are actually ran as part of the siphon test suite, and including the matplotlib 
inline magic command causes issues on TravisCI.
