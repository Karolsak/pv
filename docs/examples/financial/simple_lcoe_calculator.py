LCOE Calculation
================

Example of an LCOE calculation using an approach implemented in NREL's "Simple
LCOE Calculator", accessible at http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-lcoe.html
"""
# %%
# This example shows basic usage of pvlib's lcoe calculation with
# :py:meth:`pvlib.financial.lcoe` and :py:meth:`pvlib.financial.crf`.
# The example shown here will generate a Series of annual cost and production
# data, and a numerical LCOE. To be comparable with NREL's implemenation,
# this example adheres to the following assumptions: that energy production
# and O&M costs are constant and that the entire project is financed with a
# loan. Input values for CAPEX, capacity factor, and O&M were sourced from
# NREL's ATB for a residential system in 2022 located in Resource Class 5
# with moderate technological advancement. The discount rate is set to the
# value recommended in NREL's implementation.
