Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Corrects an error in view factor calculations which are part of
  :py:func:`pvlib.bifacial.infinite_sheds.get_irradiance`. The error
  affects rear surface irradiance by a few W/m2. As part of the correction,
  average view factors are now computed by exact formulas rather than by
  numerical integration. (:issue:`1665`, :pull:`1666`)
