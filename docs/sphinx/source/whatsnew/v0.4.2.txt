v0.4.2 ()
------------------------

This is a minor release from 0.4.0. ....


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed typo in __repr__ method of ModelChain and in its regarding test. (commit: b691358b)
* PVSystem.pvwatts_ac could not use the eta_inv_ref kwarg and
  PVSystem.pvwatts_dc could not use the temp_ref kwarg. Fixed. (:issue:`252`)

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The run_model method of the ModelChain will use the weather parameter of all weather data instead of splitting it to irradiation and weather. The irradiation parameter still works but will be removed soon.(:issue:`239`)
* delta_t kwarg is now 67.0 instead of None. IMPORTANT: Setting delta_t as None will break the code for Numba calculation. This will be fixed in a future version. (:issue:`165`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adding a complete_irradiance method to the ModelChain to make it possible to calculate missing irradiation data from the existing columns [beta] (:issue:`239`)
* Added calculate_deltat method to the spa module to calculate the time difference between terrestrial time and UT1. Specifying a scalar is sufficient for most calculations. (:issue:`165`)
