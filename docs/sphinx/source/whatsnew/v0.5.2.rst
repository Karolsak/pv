v0.5.2 (__, 2017)
-------------------------

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* removed unused 'pressure' arg from irradiance.liujordan function (:issue:`386`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Implement a reliable "gold" implementation of the single diode model (SDM)
  using a bisection method (Brent, 1973) bounded by points known to include the
  full forward-bias 1st quadrant IV-curve. Also implement a "fast" method using
  a gradient descent method (Newton-Raphson) that is not bounded, but should be
  safe for well behaved IV-curves. (:issue:`408`)
* Combine existing :func:`~pvlib.pvsystem.singlediode` method using Lambert-W
  with the two new implementations to form a wrapper, that takes an additional
  ``method`` argument ``('lambertw', 'fast')`` that defaults to the new "gold"
  bounded bisection method. (:issue:`410`)
* Add :func:`~pvlib.pvsystem.mppt` method to compute the max power point.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* fixed redeclaration of test_simplified_solis_series_elevation (:issue:`387`)
* physicaliam now returns a Series if called with a Series as an
  argument. (:issue:`397`)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Improve physicaliam doc string. (:issue:`397`)

Testing
~~~~~~~
* Test Python 3.6 on Windows with Appveyor instead of 3.4. (:issue:`392`)
* Fix failing test on pandas 0.22 (:issue:`406`)
