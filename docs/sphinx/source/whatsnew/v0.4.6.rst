.. _whatsnew_0460:

v0.4.6 ()
---------


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Method of multi-inheritance has changed to make it possible to use kwargs in
  the parent classes of LocalizedPVSystem and LocalizedSingleAxisTracker
  (:issue:`330`)
* Fix the `__repr__` method of `ModelChain`, crashing when
  `orientation_strategy` is set to `'None'` (:issue:`352`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added default values to docstrings of all functions (:issue:`336`)
* Ideal devices supported in single diode model, e.g., 
  resistance_series = 0 and/or resistance_shunt = numpy.inf (:issue:`340`)
* Computations for very near ideal devices are more numerically stable in 
  single diode model (:issue:`340`)

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Removed parameter w from _calc_d (:issue:`344`)
* Deprecated `pvsystem.v_from_i` and `pvsystem.i_from_v` functions, which will 
  be removed in a future release. Instead use `pvsystem.sdm_v_from_i` and
  `pvsystem.sdm_i_from_v`, which are ~2x slower but can handle ideal devices. 
  Note that these functions always return a numpy.ndarray (:issue:`340`)
* Added `pvsystem.sdm_current_sum` function, which computes the sum of currents 
  at the diode node in the single diode model and is used to improve numerical 
  stability in `pvsystem.sdm_v_from_i` and `pvsystem.sdm_i_from_v` for very 
  near ideal devices (:issue:`340`)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Testing
~~~~~~~

* Added explicit tests for aoi and aoi_projection functions.
* Update test of `ModelChain.__repr__` to take in account :issue:`352`
* Significant new test cases added for `pvsystem.sdm_v_from_i` and
  `pvsystem.sdm_i_from_v`, beyond but including cases for deprecated 
  `pvsystem.v_from_i` and `pvsystem.i_from_v` (:issue:`340`)
