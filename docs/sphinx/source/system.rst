System Modelling
*****************

This section deals with modelling of diffrent configurations of a PV system.
It builds on previous sections which explained the 
* Fundamentals & Basics

   * Prepration of input data timeseries
   * modelling of modules
   * modelling of inverter
    
System modelling can be scaled depending on the compelexity of the target system or the objective of the calculation.

The sequenced steps for different system types are described in the following:
