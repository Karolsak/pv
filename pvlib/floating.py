    Estimate daily stream water temperature from daily ambient air temperature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    temp_air : numeric
        Daily average ambient dry bulb temperature. [째C]

    Returns
    -------
    water_temperature : numeric
        Daily average stream water temperature. [째C]

    Notes
    -----
    Daily average stream water temperature
    :math:`T_w` is calculated from daily ambient air temperature
    :math:`T_{air}` as provided in [1]_:

    .. math::

        T_w = 5 + 0.75 \cdot T_{air}

    The predicted daily stream water temperatures had a
    standard deviation of 2.7 째C compared to measurements. Small, shallow
    streams had smaller deviations than large, deep rivers.

    It should be noted that this equation is limited to streams, i.e., water
    bodies that are well mixed in the vertical and transverse directions of a
    cross section. Also, it is only tested on ice-free streams. Consequently,
    when the mean ambient air temperature is lower than -6.66 째C, the surface
    stream water temperature is returned as ``np.nan``.

    Although this model was developed to estimate stream temperature,
    a number of publications have used it to estimate lakewater and
    seawater temperatures for floating PV without evidence of validity
    for such applications.
