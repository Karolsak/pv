    Parameters
    ----------
    axis_tilt : float, default 0
        The tilt of the axis of rotation (i.e, the y-axis defined by
        axis_azimuth) with respect to horizontal, in decimal degrees.

    axis_azimuth : float, default 0
        A value denoting the compass direction along which the axis of
        rotation lies. Measured in decimal degrees East of North.

    max_angle : float, default 90
        A value denoting the maximum rotation angle, in decimal degrees,
        of the one-axis tracker from its horizontal position (horizontal
        if axis_tilt = 0). A max_angle of 90 degrees allows the tracker
        to rotate to a vertical position to point the panel towards a
        horizon. max_angle of 180 degrees allows for full rotation.

    backtrack : bool, default True
        Controls whether the tracker has the capability to "backtrack"
        to avoid row-to-row shading. False denotes no backtrack
        capability. True denotes backtrack capability.

    gcr : float, default 2.0/7.0
        A value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker system
        which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV array
        surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules
        2 meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters
        between the tracking axes has a gcr of 2/6=0.333. If gcr is not
        provided, a gcr of 2/7 is default. gcr must be <=1.

    Determine the rotation angle of a single axis tracker when given a
    particular sun zenith and azimuth angle.

    See [1]_, [2]_ for details about the equations. Backtracking may be
    specified, and if so, a ground coverage ratio is required.

    Rotation angle is determined in a panel-oriented coordinate system.
    The tracker azimuth axis_azimuth defines the positive y-axis; the
    positive x-axis is 90 degress clockwise from the y-axis and parallel
    to the earth surface, and the positive z-axis is normal and oriented
    towards the sun. Rotation angle tracker_theta indicates tracker
    position relative to horizontal: tracker_theta = 0 is horizontal,
    and positive tracker_theta is a clockwise rotation around the y axis
    in the x, y, z coordinate system. For example, if tracker azimuth
    axis_azimuth is 180 (oriented south), tracker_theta = 30 is a
    rotation of 30 degrees towards the west, and tracker_theta = -90 is
    a rotation to the vertical plane facing east.

    Parameters
    ----------
    apparent_zenith : float, 1d array, or Series
        Solar apparent zenith angles in decimal degrees.

    apparent_azimuth : float, 1d array, or Series
        Solar apparent azimuth angles in decimal degrees.

    axis_tilt : float, default 0
        The tilt of the axis of rotation (i.e, the y-axis defined by
        axis_azimuth) with respect to horizontal, in decimal degrees.

    axis_azimuth : float, default 0
        A value denoting the compass direction along which the axis of
        rotation lies. Measured in decimal degrees East of North.

    max_angle : float, default 90
        A value denoting the maximum rotation angle, in decimal degrees,
        of the one-axis tracker from its horizontal position (horizontal
        if axis_tilt = 0). A max_angle of 90 degrees allows the tracker
        to rotate to a vertical position to point the panel towards a
        horizon. max_angle of 180 degrees allows for full rotation.

    backtrack : bool, default True
        Controls whether the tracker has the capability to "backtrack"
        to avoid row-to-row shading. False denotes no backtrack
        capability. True denotes backtrack capability.

    gcr : float, default 2.0/7.0
        A value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker system
        which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV array
        surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules
        2 meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters
        between the tracking axes has a gcr of 2/6=0.333. If gcr is not
        provided, a gcr of 2/7 is default. gcr must be <=1.

    side_slope : float, default 0.0
        The slope in degrees of the "system plane" perpendicular to the
        tracker axes. The "system plane" is defined as the plane that
        contains all of the tracker axes. EG north-south trackers on a
        3-degree eastern slope would have a 3-degree side slope, depending
        on the tracker axis azimuth. Use ``calc_system_tracker_side_slope``
        for more complicated system planes.

    Returns
    -------
    dict or DataFrame with the following columns:
        * `tracker_theta`: The rotation angle of the tracker.
          tracker_theta = 0 is horizontal, and positive rotation angles are
          clockwise.
        * `aoi`: The angle-of-incidence of direct irradiance onto the
          rotated panel surface.
        * `surface_tilt`: The angle between the panel surface and the earth
          surface, accounting for panel rotation.
        * `surface_azimuth`: The azimuth of the rotated panel, determined by
          projecting the vector normal to the panel's surface to the earth's
          surface.

    Calculate tracker axis tilt in the global reference frame when on a sloped
    plane.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system_azimuth : float
        direction of normal to slope on horizontal [degrees]
    system_zenith : float
        tilt of normal to slope relative to vertical [degrees]

    Solving for the tracker tilt on a slope is derived in the following steps:

    1. the trackers axes are in the system plane, so the ``z-coord = 0``

    2. rotate the trackers ``[x_tr_sys, y_tr_sys, 0]`` back to the global, but
       rotated by the tracker global azimuth if there is one, so that the
       tracker axis is constrained to y-z plane so that ``x-coord = 0`` ::

    3. solve for ``x_tr_sys`` ::

          x_tr_sys*cos(sys_az-tr_az)+y_tr_sys*sin(sys_az-tr_az)*cos(sys_ze) = 0
